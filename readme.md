# Installation

`composer create-project nukacode/laravel-base <path>`

# Set up
```
    npm install
    bower install
    gulp // This should run after bower install automatically
```

# Assumptions
A few assumptions are made regarding what you will be using.  By default Base assumes you will be using bootstrap with 
some common js and css vendor plugins.  If you don't want these, go through the gulpFile.js and remove what you need to.
